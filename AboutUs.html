    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
        My name is <strong>Kagiso Lencoe</strong>, and I founded KTD (Keep The Drip) in 2023. 
        KTD is more than just a clothing brand, it’s a lifestyle. 
        I started this business to give young people stylish, affordable, and authentic streetwear 
        that makes them feel confident in their own skin.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At KTD, our mission is simple: <em>to inspire and empower the youth</em> through streetwear 
        that represents culture, confidence, and unity. Every hoodie and T-shirt we design is 
        created with the idea of keeping the drip alive.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        My vision is to grow KTD into South Africa’s top youth streetwear brand and expand across Africa. 
        I want KTD to be more than a clothing line, I want it to be a movement that represents 
        style, hustle, and authenticity.
      </p>
