Project Overview:
My name is Kagiso Lencoe, and this project presents two website proposals. The first is for my clothing brand KTD (Keep The Drip), which sells hoodies, T-shirts, and caps. The website will give my customers an online store where they can browse products, shop, and connect with the brand.
The second proposal is for the Kagiso Art Foundation, which focuses on promoting art and creativity among young people. The website will showcase different artworks, share stories from local artists, and create a platform where people can support or purchase art.
Both websites aim to grow their reach, improve communication, and create more opportunities for their audiences.

Website Goal and objectives:
For KTD (Keep The Drip), the main goal of the website is to create a professional online store where customers can easily browse and purchase merchandise such as hoodies, T-shirts, and headwear. The website will also help build a strong brand identity, connect with customers through social media links, and provide updates on new drops, promotions, and collaborations. Success will be measured by online sales, customer sign-ups, website visits, and repeat purchases.
For the Kagiso Art Foundation, the website aims to showcase local and upcoming artists through an online gallery, allowing visitors to view, appreciate, and even purchase art. It will also raise awareness about the foundation’s mission of promoting creativity and art education, while offering online registration for art workshops, exhibitions, and community projects. In addition, the site will include a donation and sponsorship platform to support young artists, with performance measured through event registrations, donations received, artworks displayed, and overall online traffic growth.

Key features and functionalities:
The KTD (Keep The Drip) website will have an online store where customers can browse and buy hoodies, T-shirts, and caps. It will include secure payments, product images, size guides, and reviews. The site will also link to Instagram and TikTok for engagement and allow customers to subscribe for updates on new drops and promotions.
The Kagiso Art Foundation website will feature an online gallery to display artworks from local artists, with options to register for workshops and exhibitions. It will include a donation page for sponsors, artist profiles, and event updates. Visitors will also be able to connect with the foundation through social media and a simple contact form.
